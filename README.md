# Overview
Our mission is to create a digital archive that preserves the memory of exceptional games that have been delisted from the Google Play Store. These games, once beloved by many, have vanished from the platform, leaving behind a void for those who once enjoyed them and curiosity for those who never had the chance.

Through this project, we aim to restore these games' legacy, offering a nostalgic journey for those who remember them fondly, while also creating new and exciting memories for those discovering them for the first time. Our curated list will allow people to relive the past and experience the joy these games brought, ensuring they are not forgotten and can be enjoyed by future generations.

# Important Notice to Developers
We respect the rights of all developers. If you are the developer of a game featured in our archive and prefer not to have your game included, please let us know. You can easily open an issue through our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/MRCYODev/Delisted-Games-from-Google-Playstore/issues) to request removal. We will promptly address your concerns and take the necessary steps to remove your game from our archive.

# Anti-Piracy Statement
Our project firmly stands against piracy. All games in our archive were originally downloaded and backed up from the official Google Play Store while they were still available. We do not distribute or encourage the illegal downloading of games. Our goal is to preserve the memory of these games, not to infringe upon the rights of developers or publishers.
